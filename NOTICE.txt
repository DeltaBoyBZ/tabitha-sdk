For any of these files, the corresponding licence is identified in comments near the top of that file. 

The copyright holder and main contributor would like to make the following remarks concerning the choice of licensing: 

1. The ALv2 does not recognise work which is separable from the covered work as being derivative. 
    In particular, software compiled and linked via:
The Tabitha SDK has two main dependencies, provided in this distribution as Git submodules. 
Since this arguably constitutes a redistribution of those works, we reproduce their licences in the 
dependency_licences folder in the root of the repository. 

1. The LLVM Project is provided under the terms of the ALv2 with extra terms.
